1) Opening up django admin commands

4) Creating ann app (You need to be in manage.py section in order to create an new app like blog, checkout etc...)

	python manage.py startapp <name_of_the_app> 

5) Creating an admin user you need to create an database before using this

	python manage.py createsuperuser 

	Before above command you need to take the below steps first

	i) python manage.py makemigrations 

	ii) python manage.py migrate 

6) Viewing the sql code 

	python manage.py sqlmigrate <name> <migration_number> 

Note: Migrations are usefull because it allows us to make changes to our database even after it's created and data in that database so if we didn't have way to run migrations
then we would have to run some compilicated SQL code to update our database structure so it didn't mess with the current data but with migtrations we can simply make whatever
changes we need run make migrations and then run "migrate" and it will make all of those changfes for us.
